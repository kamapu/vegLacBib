This information can usually be found in the Materials and methods or Study site sections.\nWe will use the following publication as an example:\n\n\nLuebert F, Gajardo R (2000). “Vegetación de los Andes áridos del norte de Chile.” Lazaroa, 21, 111-130.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall Google Earth\n\n\n\nIf you have not already done so, you will need to install Google Earth Pro on your desktop. To do this, visit this link.\n\n\nWhen you open Google Earth, you will see a left pane that resembles a file browser and is organised into two top-level categories, My Places and Temporary Places."

In this example we have used the name georeferenced-papers.\nNow right-click on the new folder and follow the same steps to create a subfolder. This time name the subfolder with the publication ID, which in our example is Luebert2000. It is very important to avoid mistakes in this step, otherwise the merging of coordinates with the reference entry in the database may fail."

Each publication folder can contain more than one placemark (in the case of multiple survey locations). For comparison, you can look at this example."
